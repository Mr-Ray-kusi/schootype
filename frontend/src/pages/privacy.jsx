          <p className="mt-2">
            Schooltype collects a school administrator email only to create and operate your school
            account. That includes sign-in, email verification, password setup, plan and billing
            notices, and essential service messages. This is necessary to provide the service, not
            a marketing list. We do not sell contact details.

          <h2 className="font-display text-lg font-bold text-white">School records</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Student, staff, parent, attendance, fee, and message data is entered by the school.
            The school is responsible for that information. Schooltype stores and processes it so
            the school can run attendance, IDs, messaging, and related tools. Public ID pages show
            only school-facing identity details (name, photo, class or role, and school). They do
            not publish parent phone numbers, emails, home addresses, or dates of birth.

          <h2 className="font-display text-lg font-bold text-white">What we store in your browser</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            After you sign in we keep a session token and school profile in local storage so you
            stay signed in. If you choose “remember email”, only that email is saved on this
            device. You can clear these by signing out or clearing site data.

            Depending on features you use, data may be processed by hosting and database providers
            (including Vercel and Supabase), email delivery, Google sign-in, Paystack for wallet
            payments, and SMS providers such as Twilio. Payment details are handled by Paystack;
            Schooltype does not store your MoMo PIN.

          <p className="mt-2">
            You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your school administrator
            account data. Schools should handle requests about student and parent records they
            entered. To make a request, sign in and contact Schooltype from your school account,
            or use the email address on your account.
